## Project topics:
C++ casts

## List of exercises:
* ### ex00: Conversion of scalar types


Write a program that takes as parameter a string representation of a C++ literal in
its most common form. This literal must belong to one of the following a scalar types:
char, int, float or double. Except for char parameters, only the decimal notation will be
used.

Examples of char literals: ’c’, ’a’, ...

To make things simple, please note that non displayable characters shouldn’t be used as
inputs. If a conversion to char is not displayable, prints an informative message.

Examples of int literals: 0, -42, 42...

Examples of float literals: 0.0f, -4.2f, 4.2f...

You have to handle these pseudo literals as well (you know, for science): -inff, +inff
and nanf.

Examples of double literals: 0.0, -4.2, 4.2...

You have to handle these pseudo literals as well (you know, for fun): -inf, +inf and nan.

You have to first detect the type of the literal passed as parameter, convert it from
string to its actual type, then convert it explicitly to the three other data types. Lastly,
display the results.

If a conversion does not make any sense or overflows, display a message to inform
the user that the type conversion is impossible. Include any header you need in order to
handle numeric limits and special values.

* ### ex01: Serialization

Implement the following functions:

*uintptr_t serialize(Data\* ptr);*

It takes a *pointer* and converts it to the *unsigned integer type uintptr_t*.

*Data\* deserialize(uintptr_t raw);*

It takes an *unsigned integer parameter* and converts it to a *pointer* to **Data**.

Write a program to test that your functions works as expected.

You must create a non-empty (it means it has data members) **Data** structure.
Use *serialize()* on the address of the Data object and pass its return value to
*deserialize()*. Then, ensure the return value of *deserialize()* compares equal to the
original *pointer*.


* ### ex02: Identify real type

Implement a **Base** class that has a public virtual destructor only. Create three empty
classes **A**,**B** and **C**, that publicly inherit from **Base**.

Implement the following functions:

*Base \*generate(void);*
It randomly instanciates A, B or C and returns the instance as a Base pointer. Feel free
to use anything you like for the random choice implementation.

*void identify(Base\* p);*

It prints the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A", "B" or "C".

*void identify(Base& p);*

It prints the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A", "B" or "C". Using a pointer
inside this function is forbidden.
